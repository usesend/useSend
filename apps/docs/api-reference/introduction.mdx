## Base URL

useSend's API is built on REST principles and is served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:

```sh Terminal
https://app.usesend.com/api/
```

## Authentication

Authentication to Usend's API is performed via the Authorization header with a Bearer token. To authenticate, you need to include the Authorization header with the word Bearer followed by your token in your API requests like so:

```sh Terminal
Authorization: Bearer us_12345
```

You can create a new token/API key under your useSend [Developer Settings](https://app.usesend.com/dev-settings/api-keys).

## Idempotency

Use the optional `Idempotency-Key` header on `POST /v1/emails` and `POST /v1/emails/batch` to make requests safe to retry. Reusing a key with the same request body returns the original response; reusing it with different input returns `409 Conflict` so you can detect mistakes. Keys expire after 24 hours.
