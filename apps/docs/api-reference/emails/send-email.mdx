Send a transactional email via the public API.

## Idempotency

Pass the optional `Idempotency-Key` header to make the request safe to retry. The key can be up to 256 characters. The server stores the canonical request body and behaves as follows:

- Same key + same request body → returns the original `emailId` with `200 OK` without re‑sending.
- Same key + different request body → returns `409 Conflict` with `code: NOT_UNIQUE` so you can detect the mismatch.
- Same key while another request is still being processed → returns `409 Conflict`; retry after a short delay or once the first request completes.

Entries expire after 24 hours. Use a unique key per logical send (for example, an order or signup ID).
